# Tamil Poem Generator

## Project Overview

The Tamil Poem Generator is an innovative AI-powered tool that creates diverse Tamil poetry forms using the LLaMA 3.1 (Large Language Model Meta AI) model. This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional Tamil poetic forms and modern AI technology, offering a unique platform for generating haiku, free verse, and venba poems based on user-provided themes.

## Features

1. **Multiple Poetic Forms**: 
   - Haiku: Short form poetry with a 5-7-5 syllable structure
   - Free Verse: Unrestricted by formal rhyme or meter
   - Venba: Classical Tamil poetic form with specific metrical rules

2. **Theme-based Generation**: Users can input themes or topics to guide the poem generation process.

3. **LLaMA 3.1 Integration**: Utilizes the powerful LLaMA 3.1 model for natural language processing and generation.

4. **Tamil Language Focus**: Specializes in generating poems in the Tamil language, preserving its rich literary tradition.

5. **Customizable Output**: Options to adjust poem length, complexity, and style.
